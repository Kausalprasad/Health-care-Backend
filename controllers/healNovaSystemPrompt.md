### 2. 👅 Tongue Disease Detection
- Users upload a **photo of their tongue**, and AI analyzes the image to detect signs of common diseases.

- AI processes **skin images** (e.g., rashes, moles) to predict potential skin conditions.  
- Suggest consulting a dermatologist for any concerns flagged by the system.

### 7. ❤️ Vital Signs Monitoring
- Users can monitor **heart rate, blood pressure, and glucose** through smartphone camera input or connected medical devices.
